🔐 Secure Text Encryption and Decryption Using Linear Transformations and Random Factors

A Python-based project developed during my internship at Aviratha Digital Labs.
It provides a lightweight, fast, and secure method to encrypt and decrypt text using linear transformations, ASCII manipulation, and random factors.

✨ Features

Custom encryption algorithm

Accurate decryption with key validation

Random factors for improved security

Fast and efficient for real-time use

Simple and lightweight (only Python required)

Graph performance analysis using Matplotlib

GUI built using Tkinter

📁 Project Structure
Encrydecry/
├── ende.py          # Main encryption & decryption script
├── README.md        # Project documentation

▶️ How to Run

Install Python (3.8+ recommended)

Open Terminal inside the project folder

Run:

python ende.py


Use the GUI to enter text, key, and perform encryption/decryption

🧠 How the Algorithm Works

Converts each character to ASCII

Applies linear transformation using a multiplier derived from the key

Adds random factors so every output is unique

Decryption reverses the math to restore the original text

Key validation ensures only the correct key works

📊 Performance Analysis

Encryption and decryption time graphs plotted using Matplotlib

Real-time performance tracking

Helps measure speed and efficiency of the algorithm

🧩 Skills & Technologies Used

Python

Tkinter

Matplotlib

Linear Algebra (Transformations)

Cryptography basics

Debugging and optimization
